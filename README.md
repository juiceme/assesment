# Coding Assessment in Python

## Mission

Implement a procedure named RotateImage. The input of the procedure is a bitmap of N x N unsigned integers where N is variable. The bitmap contains an arbitrary image. The procedure creates a new bitmap so that the image is rotated by 90 degrees in clockwise direction.Bonus assignment for test 2: Implement the procedure in such way, that the given bitmap is rotated in place, i.e. without creating a new copy.
